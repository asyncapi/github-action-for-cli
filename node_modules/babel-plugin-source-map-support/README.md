# NAME

babel-plugin-source-map-support - a Babel plugin which automatically makes stack traces source-map aware

# INSTALL

    $ npm install source-map-support --save
    $ npm install babel-plugin-source-map-support --save-dev

# SYNOPSIS

`$ cat test.js`

```javascript
import foo from 'foo';
import bar from 'bar';

foo(bar);
```

`$ babel --plugins source-map-support test.js`

```javascript
import 'source-map-support/register';
import foo from 'foo';
import bar from 'bar';

foo(bar);
```

# DESCRIPTION

This is a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
[plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/advanced/plugins/) which prepends the
following statement to source files:

```javascript
import 'source-map-support/register';
```

In conjunction with the
[source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) module,
**which must be installed separately**, this statement hooks into the v8
stack-trace API to translate call sites in the transpiled code back to their
corresponding locations in the original code.

Note: this only works in environments which support the v8 stack-trace API
(e.g. Node.js and Chrome), though it's harmless in other environments.

The source-map-support module only needs to be registered in the top-level
file(s) of an application, but it no-ops if it has already been loaded, so
there's no harm in registering it in every file.

You probably don't want to use this plugin when compiling code for the web
because you probably don't want to bundle source-maps and the
source-map-support module in minified code. An easy way to limit the plugin's
scope to development/test builds is to use Babel's
[`env` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#env), e.g.:

```javascript
{
    env: {
        development: {
            sourceMaps: 'inline',
            plugins: ['source-map-support', ...]
        }
    },

    presets: [ ... ]
}
```

Note that source-maps don't need to be inlined in each file. They can be
externalised by using the `{ sourceMaps: true }` option. This adds a link to
the bottom of each file which points to its generated source-map, e.g.:

```javascript
{
    env: {
        development: {
            sourceMaps: true,
            plugins: ['source-map-support', ...]
        }
    },
}
```

```javascript
// index.js footer:
//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```
